# Roadmap

This page describes where Azul3D is heading in the future. Some of these items may be developed sooner than others, some might not be developed at all. It's an *ideal* list.

* [Future Platforms](#future-platforms)
* [Model Loader](#model-loader)

# Future Platforms

In the future, we would like to support the following platforms:</p>

* [Android](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/9)
* [iOS](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/11)

# Model Loader

To make great games, Azul3D will need a 3D model loader capable of loading static and animated 3D models / scenes. Ideally it will have an exporter for the Blender 3D suite.

Track progress [here](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/12).

# User Interface

Many game engines today provide user interfaces -- but they are often lacking in several areas. Azul3D could accel and provide a robust user interface library suitable for games and many other types of applications.

Track progress [here](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/14).

# Sprite Rendering

Azul3D could provide the ability to render simple static or animated sprites.

Track progress [here](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/15).

# Bullet Physics

Bullet is the leading open source 3D physics engine. For 3D games Azul3D should provide a nice Go wrapper to the Bullet physics engine.

Track progress [here](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/16).
