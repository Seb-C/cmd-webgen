# Human Friendly

This section describes [the license](#text) in a human friendly way, *note that we are not lawyers and cannot provide legal advice in any way to you*.

**The following is not legal advice.**

Azul3D code is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD license, *the same license that Go uses*. Generally, all the packages are safe for use in commercial applications free of charge if you:

* Include the license text / link to this page in your program's relevant area.
* Mention The Azul3D Authors / link to the [authors page](/doc/authors.html).
* Do not pretend that we endorse you or your products.

**End of non-legal advice.**

# Authors

The Azul3D Authors are listed in full on the [authors page](/doc/authors.html).

# Contributing

*Contributing is very easy and operates through [GitHub](http://github.com/azul3d)'s standard pull request system. All contributions in any form are licensed under the terms set forth on this page, if you do not agree to these terms then do not submit any such contribution.*

Having your name appear on the [authors page](/doc/authors.html) allows you to receive proper credit for your work, whether small or large, and also allows others to know who is behind the Azul3D open source project.

If you are not already on listed on the [authors page](/doc/authors.html), then notify *Stephen Gutekanst* (<ROT13fgrcura.thgrxnafg@tznvy.pbz>) and you will be added to the page upon your consent.

Optionally, you can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/azul3d/cmd-webgen/blob/master/pages/doc/authors.md) to the authors page. Email addresses listed on the authors page are ROT13 encoded in the Markdown/HTML, and decoded in Javascript to avoid spam. You can use [an online tool](http://www.rot13.com/index.php) to perform the encoding process for you.
